Background
============
The "Data and Materials" folder contains all the organized data from various tasks needed to construct GEE models(GEE_final(children)_ROIall.xlsx),as well as the similarity values between every pair of emotions from all participants' sorting & mouse tracking tasks (sorting & MT.sav). The "Codes" folder contains programs for building GEE models using RStudio(GEE_emotionRSA.R).

Required Software
=============
Below is a list of software required to run the files in the "Codes" directory, along with links to their download pages and user guides:

- RStudio 2023.12.1: https://www.filehorse.com/download-rstudio/
- SPSS 26.0: https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics

Example Usage
=============
- GEE_emotionRSA.R: This program can be run directly after supplementing the path information. It includes the construction of GEE models and tests for simple effects of interactions. By modifying the variables in the GEE model, different regression models can be obtained. The program will ultimately output the results of the GEE model and the interaction effect tests.

- Additionally, the process for analyzing the sorting & MT task in SPSS is not provided here. This analysis does not require coding and can be completed by navigating through the SPSS menu to “Analyze - General Linear Model - Repeated Measures”.
