Background
============
The “Data and Materials” directory contains files related to participants’ emotion understanding assessed through a sorting task. It includes each participant’s accuracy scores (MT_acc.xlsx) and conceptual similarity scores (MT_similarity_matrix.xlsx).

The analysis of the sorting task using SPSS is not included in the codebase, as it does not require scripting. This analysis can be performed via the SPSS menu by selecting:
Analyze → General Linear Model → Repeated Measures.
