Background
============
The "Data and Materials" directory contains files related to participants’ conceptual representations of emotion words, based on similarity judgments and comparisons with adult reference data:
	•	MDS.sav: SPSS data file containing multidimensional scaling (MDS) results used to derive similarity-based representations of each participant’s conceptual space for emotion words.
	•	average_rating.xlsx: Contains correlation values between each child’s average ratings and the adult reference ratings for each emotion word.
	•	rating_similarity_matrix.xlsx: Includes conceptual similarity scores for each participant, calculated for each emotion pair based on their individual rating patterns.


The process for analyzing the rating task in SPSS is not provided here. This analysis does not require coding and can be completed by navigating through the SPSS menu to “Analyze - General Linear Model - Repeated Measures”.
